9‑Line MEDEVAC (Instructor Handout & Student
Worksheet)
NO‑GO: Candidate cannot send Lines 1–9 within the standard, uses wrong brevity codes, or
transmits out of sequence/procedure (absent equipment failure).
Purpose. A 9‑Line MEDEVAC rapidly requests medical evacuation and communicates pickup details, patient
status, and site conditions.
Call Flow — Quick Reference
Prep: Build Lines 1–9 from TCCC cards.
Initial Contact (Lines 1–5 on MEDEVAC freq):
"[Higher], this is [Your Call Sign], 9-Line to follow, over."
Send Lines 1–5, then state “Over.”
Send Lines 6–9
Close: “Over.”
Standards: Prepare within \~3 min; transmit  Lines 1–5 within \~25 sec of initial contact;
transmit Lines 6–9 within \~1 min thereafter. Use proper brevity codes, RT procedures, and
pronunciation.
9‑Line Format (with Examples)
Line 1 — Pickup Location (MGRS). 6‑digit grid (MINIMUM) with GZD, accurate ≤200 m. 
Example (Line 1): Grid 16T EG 1234 5678;
Line 2 — Radio Freq, Call Sign & Suffix. Operational frequency you’ll use for follow‑on; include your call
sign/suffix.
Example (Line 2): Call sign VIKING 2‑1, Freq 38900.
Line 3 — Patients by Precedence (state number per category; say “Break” between).
A # — Urgent
B # — Urgent‑Surgical
C # — Priority
D # — Routine

E # — Convenience
Example (Line 3): 2A, Break, 1C.
Line 4 — Special Equipment Required.
A — None
B — Hoist
C — Extrication equipment
D — Ventilator
Example (Line 4): A.
Line 5 — Patients by Type (say “Break” between).
L # — Litter
A # — Ambulatory
Example (Line 5): 1L, Break, 2A.
_____
"Over."
Line 6 — Security at Pickup Site (wartime).
N — No enemy in area
P — Possible enemy in area
E — Enemy in area
X — Enemy in area (armed escort required)
Example (Line 6): P.
Line 7 — Marking Method for Pickup Site.
A — Panels
B — Pyrotechnic signal
C — Smoke
D — None
E — Other
Example (Line 7): C (Green).

Line 8 — Patient Nationality & Status.
A — U.S. military
B — U.S. civilian
C — Non‑U.S. military
D — Non‑U.S. civilian
E — Enemy POW
Example (Line 8): 2A, 1D.
Line  9  —  Terrain  (peacetime)  /  NBC  (as  directed). Provide  pertinent  terrain  description (slope,
obstacles, LZ hazards, approach). In a non‑CBRNE wartime lane, terrain is acceptable and often expected.
Example (Line 9): Flat 100×100 meter dirt lot; wires on west edge; best approach from east.
Radio Script — Example
"DUSTOFF 3, this is VIKING 1‑6, 9-Line request to follow, over."
DUSTOFF: "VIKING 2‑1, send it, over."
Line 1: "16T EG 1234 5678"
Line 2: "VIKING 2‑1, 38900."
Line 3: "2A, Break, 1C."
Line 4: "A."
Line 5: "1L, Break, 2A."
"Over."
DUSTOFF: "VIKING 2‑1, send Lines 6 through 9, over."
Line 6: "P."
Line 7: "C (Green)."
Line 8: "2A, 1D."
Line 9: "Flat 100×100 meter dirt lot; wires west; approach east."
"Over."
Tips for Students
Build Lines 1–5 first from map/TCCC cards; rehearse brevity codes out loud.
For Lines 3 & 5, say numbers first (e.g., “2A, Break, 1C”).
Line 6: give the single‑letter code; don’t narrate the threat picture unless asked.

Line 7: state method and color if smoke/pyro is used (e.g., “C, green”).
Line 9: keep it LZ‑useful (size, slope, obstacles, wires, approach).
Speak once, clearly; use pro‑words; avoid filler.
Common Errors → Fix
Missing GZD / bad grid (Line 1): Re‑center protractor; sanity‑check with terrain.
Wrong order/omissions: Keep a laminated 9‑blank‑line pad; tick each line as you send it.
Mixing narrative into coded lines: Codes only unless amplifying guidance is requested.
Forgetting to state “Break” where required (Lines 3 & 5).

Use these injects to build a full 9‑Line. Keep codes short and Line 9 terrain concise.
Lane 1 — IED Blast, Two WIA
Convoy struck by a small IED near a dry creek bed. One Soldier with shrapnel wounds to thigh (controlled
bleeding),  another  with  suspected  concussion  (dazed,  vomiting).  No  contact  observed,  but  locals  are

gathering. Terrain is flat, dusty lot with light poles and low wires to the west; solid approach from the east.
You have green smoke and a panel available.
Lane 2 — Heat Casualty, Ambulatory
During a ruck, one Soldier collapses from heat stress but recovers after cooling and fluids; ambulatory with
assistance. No enemy indicators. Open field LZ 60×60 m, slight slope south‑to‑north, no wires. You can mark
with orange panel; pyro not authorized.
Lane 3 — Complex Terrain, Hoist Required
Patrol in steep ravine; one Soldier suffers ankle fracture (litter) and another mild laceration (ambulatory).
Movement to ridge is unsafe without hoist. Unknown enemy presence; earlier reports of sporadic small
arms 5 km north. Best mark is purple smoke; tree canopy near LZ and boulders along approach.
Lane 4 — Contact Likely, Armed Escort
Following a TIC 30 minutes ago, one casualty with penetrating chest trauma (urgent‑surgical) and one with
arm fracture (priority). Enemy scouts reported in vicinity; armed escort recommended. LZ is a hard‑packed
road segment, 40×70 m, berms on both sides; wires cross 30 m west of midpoint. Red pyro available.
Lane 5 — Urban Courtyard
Partnered patrol in urban district; non‑U.S. civilian vendor struck by debris, bleeding from scalp (priority).
No active threat; crowd compliant. Courtyard 50×50 m with trees on north edge; best approach from south;
able to throw green smoke over wall on call.
