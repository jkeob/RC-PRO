Call for Fire (Instructor Handout & Student
Worksheet)
NO‑GO: Candidate does not bracket correctly during adjustment. (Based on EIB doctrine.)
Purpose. Request  and  adjust  indirect  fire  on  a  target  using  three  transmissions,  then  adjust  to
Fire‑for‑Effect (FFE) and report effects.
Task, Conditions, Standards
Task: Transmit a call for fire and adjust rounds to FFE.
Conditions: Candidate plots/derives data, determines direction and distance, and transmits to FDC using
three transmissions. (Wartime context implied by excerpt.)
Standards:
Transmit Call for Fire in three transmissions:
Observer identification and warning order.
Eight‑digit grid and direction (mills) to target (must be accurate within 250 meters).
OR POLAR Mission: Distance + Direction (meters, mills)
Target description, method of engagement, and method of fire and control.
Adjust Fire IAW steps below; bracket correctly to a 100‑meter bracket or achieve range‑correct
spotting; maintain deviation on line; transmit all corrections in meters.
Fire for Effect: Upon achieving the standard, enter FFE and report effects.
Candidate Preparation (before first transmission)
Plot/Note current position grid. (MGRS - GZD)
Plot/Note enemy position grid/polar.
Calculate direction in mills.
Fill out CFF laminated card.

First Transmission: Observer identification & warning order.
Example: "FDC, THIS IS VIKING 2‑1, ADJUST FIRE, OVER."
Second Transmission: Eight‑digit grid to target (accurate within 250 m).
Example: "GRID 16T EG 1234 5678, DIRECTION, 1 600 MILLS,  OVER."
Third Transmission: Target description, Method of Engagement, Method of Fire and Control (direction
if desired).
Example: "1 x INFANTRY SQUAD IN THE OPEN, FIRE WHEN READY, OVER."

POLAR MISSION:
First Transmission: Observer identification & warning order.
Example: "FDC, THIS IS VIKING 2‑1, ADJUST FIRE, POLAR, OVER."
Second Transmission: **Distance and Direction **to target (accurate within 250 m).
Example: "Distance 1000 METERS, DIRECTION, 1 600 MILLS,  OVER."
Third Transmission: Target description, Method of Engagement, Method of Fire and Control (direction
if desired).
Example: "1 x INFANTRY SQUAD IN THE OPEN, FIRE WHEN READY, OVER."

Adjust Fire (per provided doctrine)
Spotting: For each impact, spot Right/Left and Over/Short of target.
Range correction (Over/Short) & Bracketing:
When the first range spotting is observed, make a correction that results in a spotting in the
opposite direction (start a bracket). NO‑GO if not bracketed correctly.
Guide to establish bracket (use the estimated round impact distance to target):
> 400 m → Add/Drop 800 m
> 200 and < 400 m → Add/Drop 400 m
> 100 and < 200 m → Add/Drop 200 m
< 100 m → Add/Drop 100 m
Add/Drop 50 m and announce FIRE FOR EFFECT
Shot/Shot: After each correction the Grader will state,  “Shot over”; Candidate replies  “Shot out.” The
grader relocates to the new impact and indicates position; Candidate sends next correction.
Example: If first round is 50 mils left and 250 m short on a target at 2100 m:
Range: to get an over next, ADD 400 to start successive bracketing.
Correction to FDC: "RIGHT 100 — ADD 400 — OVER."
Continue splitting the range bracket until a  100‑meter bracket is split or a  range‑correct spotting is
observed; keep deviation on line; send all corrections in meters.
Fire for Effect & End of Mission
Enter FFE when a 100‑meter bracket is split or a range‑correct spotting is observed.
Observe results and send a brief effects report.
Example: "EOM, TARGET #____, TARGET DESTROYED, ESTIMATE TWO CASUALTIES, OVER."
CFF — Example 
Observer: "FDC, THIS IS VIKING 2‑1, ADJUST FIRE, OVER."

Practice Lanes — 5 Situations with Answer Keys
(Aligned to Doctrine)
Each lane provides a short  situation paragraph followed by a  sample call & adjust that
follows  the  three‑transmission  format,  includes  an  MTO,  uses  meters for  corrections,
maintains the bracket guide, and ends with FFE → EOM. DTGs and grids are placeholders for
training maps.
Lane 1 — Squad in the Open Near Ridgeline
Situation. From OP VIKING 2‑1 you observe an enemy squad moving in the open along a ridgeline saddle.
You have clear LOS, map, compass, and binoculars. Estimated range \~2100 m, direction 1300 MILLS.
