ASIP Radio Setup — Quick Handout (CST Video
Transcript)
Scope. This handout distills the provided video transcript into a step‑by‑step setup/check
guide for an ASIP (AN/PRC‑119 series) at CST. It covers battery, antenna, handset (mic), and
basic plaintext single‑channel programming.
What you need on hand
Radio body
Battery
Antenna (whip)
Handset/Mic
Battery check: Use the notch/indicator on the battery to gauge remaining charge. Even if it
reads 14–20 hours, request/bring spares so comms don’t die during CST.
1) Install the battery
Lift the battery latch; twist to free; open the battery door.
Align the small battery plug with the matching receptacle and fully seat it (same side orientation
per the transcript).
Re‑seat the battery pack: hook the far side first, ensure it pops in and sits flat. Do not force it.
Press the door down, rotate the latch toward the open area until you feel resistance, then lock. The
door should sit flush and not spring up.
Quick check: With a good seat, the door resists upward pressure and the latch holds without wobble.
2) Attach antenna and handset (mic)
Antenna
Place the antenna base squarely on the antenna port.
Thread/screw until snug—no wobble.
Handset/Mic
Open the audio port cover.
Align handset connector; press straight down to fully seat the gasket.
Rotate counter‑clockwise (as shown in the transcript) until it locks. Tug test: lift gently—the
connector should not pop off.

RTO tip: Verify antenna and mic are  tight. If your site allows, tape strain‑relief on cable/
antenna to prevent flopping/snags while moving.
3) Power up and enter LOAD mode
From OFF, rotate the function knob to LD (LOAD).
Wait for the display (e.g., WAIT, then NO KEY). You’ll use MENU/CLEAR to scroll.
4) Basic settings (plaintext, single‑channel)
Use MENU/CLEAR to cycle, number keys to set values, CHANGE where applicable.
VOL: Press a number 1–9 to set volume (you’ll hear a beep).
CHAN: Set Channel.
PWR: Press CHANGE → 7 to set HIGH if needed; otherwise leave LOW.
MODE: Set to Single Channel (not Frequency Hop).
COMSEC: Set to PT (Plain Text).
You should hear tone/ringing stop once you’re on the correct net in PT.
5) Enter the operating frequency
Press FREQ.
Press MENU/CLEAR to ready the entry.
Enter the 5‑digit frequency (keyed as 50000).
Press STO (STORE) to save.
Verify your earlier settings: PWR, MODE = SC, CHAN = 1, COMSEC = PT.
6) Place the radio ON and check
Rotate from LD to ON.
Use SQ (squelch) as needed and perform a quick radio check on the assigned net.
If no audio/handset issues: Re‑seat the audio connector (press straight down, lock), confirm antenna tight,
confirm PT / SC and correct frequency.
7) Disassembly (reverse order)
Rotate from ON to Z (to clear), then to OFF.
Remove handset: unlock and pull straight off; close audio port cover.

Remove antenna; stow safely (tape if needed to avoid flopping).
Remove battery: lift latch, rotate, lift door, disconnect plug; re‑install door so nothing is lost.
Goal: Don’t lose components. Turn‑in with radio, antenna, mic, and battery accounted for.
Quick Troubleshooting (from transcript cues)
Mic pops off: It wasn’t locked—seat fully, then rotate to lock; tug test.
No RX/TX in PT: Verify MODE = Single Channel, COMSEC = PT, CHAN = 1, correct FREQ stored.
Weak/No power: Swap battery; ensure latch is locked and door is flush.
Floppy antenna/cable: Tighten and consider tape for movement.
Pocket Card (Cut‑Out)
1 Battery: plug → seat → latch lock
2 Antenna: seat → thread snug
3 Handset: seat → rotate to lock (tug test)
4 LD (LOAD): wait for display
5 Settings: VOL → CH1 → PWR (L/H) → MODE SC → COMSEC PT
6 FREQ: FREQ → MENU/CLEAR → 5 digits → STO
7 ON: SQ as needed → Radio check
8 Shutdown: ON→Z→OFF → remove mic/ant/battery → stow
